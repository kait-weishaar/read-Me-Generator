# Professional README Generator

## Description
A quality README is essential to the successful communication of a project. It helps users understand the intent and usage of an application as well as any installation requirements. The quality of a README often can be the difference between a project being perceived as bad or good. It allows a developer to take advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what an application does, explain the technologies used, and possibly explain challenges and areas for future development. A good README helps both a project and a developer stand out on Github and in the job market. This application aims to smooth the somewhat tedious task of creating a quality README by creating an interface in which the user merely has to answer questions about the project, and then a quality README file is generated for them based on their responses.

## Technologies
The application is run entirely in the node.js enivronment, and the application functionality is created using javascript with an inquirer dependency to ease the process of getting and packaging data from the user.

## Installation
To properly use the application, the user must first download and install node.js. They also must download NPM Inquirer.

## Usage
The user must download the respository and navigate to the develop folder in the terminal. From there, the user simply has to type node index to initiate the application. For a video tutorial please [Click Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rdXJMckBaGf7xklGCDxezoHB7Zlf7Fof/view)
